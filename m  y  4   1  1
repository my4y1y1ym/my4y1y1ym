The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is issuing this final rule to amend its regulations governing payday, vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans.

Specifically, the Bureau is revoking provisions of those regulations that: provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan, including payday and vehicle title loans, without reasonably determining that consumers have the ability to repay those loans according to their terms; prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; exempt certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and establish related definitions, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.
